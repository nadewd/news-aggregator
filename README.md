# News Aggregator App

I created this news aggregator application to provide users with a quick snapshot of current affairs while also providing them ability to search across different sites and articles. The app uses token-based authorization to log users in. The news articles are accessed via News API wich is an easy-to-use REST API that returns JSON search results for current and historic news articles with over 80,000 worldwide sources. Upon searching for articles via a keyword search, the user can then save the article by clicking the "Add to Saved Articles" button. This app is currently not as comprehensive as I would like but I enjoyed working with APIs and will continue to build out this project as I think a well-crafted news-aggregator could be useful to myself and other users.
